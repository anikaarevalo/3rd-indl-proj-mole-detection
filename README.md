# Mole detection app for skinCare 


## Description
skinCare, a healthcare company, is in the process of launching **an AI solution that classifies skin lesions**. The company plans on presenting a prototype to their clients (i.e. professionals and experts in the field of skin medicine) whose patients stand to benefit from a tool that would be able to detect moles that need to be handled by doctors.

As the data scientist contracted for the job, my approach to this short mission is **transfer Learning using a pre-trained deep learning model called MobileNet for image classification**. To create an end-to-end machine learning solution, I first started by downloading the HAM10000 dataset from Kaggle which were the raw materials from which a web app to classify skin lesions is based on. 

Suffice it to say, the **key components of my machine learning pipeline are:**

I. **Data Augmentation using Keras** to augment training data during pre-processing;

II. **Keras Callbacks** while compiling the model during training phase ; and

III. (Models run locally in the browser, meaning that the user’s data never leaves their device.)


## Installation
The following software and tools were utilised in this project:

1. Data analysis
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Pandas and Numpy
- Matplotlib 

2. Machine learning
- Scitkit Learn
- Tensorflow 2.3.0
- Keras

3. Web application deployment
- 

## Usage
This is an easily-accessible yet effective **application that accurately detects and classifies skin lesions based on a photographic image**. At this stage of the product cycle development, it is **a proof of concept that skinCare can show to their clients, such as dermatologists,** who are open to leveraging AI in their own practice.
